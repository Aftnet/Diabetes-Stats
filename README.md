# Diabetes Stats

By [Alberto Fustinoni](http://aftnet.net)

Diabetes Stats is a WPF application to help physicians keep track of their diabetic patients. Patient profiles can be created and exam records can be added to them: the program then allows users to answer questions such as "How many patients had glycemia over 130 in the last 4 months?" instantly.

The program's user interface is built using WPF, while data storage and querying is handled by an embedded SQL Server Compact instance and .net's Entity Framework.

## System requirements

Windows XP or later, .net framework 4 or later
